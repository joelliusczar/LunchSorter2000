### Problem that we want to solve ####
Let's introduce Derick. 
Derick is in charge of organizing lunch and dinner at a week long conference and he wants to encouraged mingling so for the meals he has assigned seating, and restaurant. Monday, this is not a not a problem because he can just randomly junk people into groups. After he's grouped  people for dinner, he runs into a slight problem: one of the conference goers, AJ, comes and complains that he has been assigned pizza two meals in a row. AJ's a little bit of a pissant though, so he's the only one with a problem. 
Tueday more people complain to Derick about how he is grouping them together. Katie has been assigned the soup place for the third time in a row. Ron, Horratio, and Quintin have eaten together every meal this week and are ready to branch out.
And as the conference continues it gets harder and more difficult to assign people in such a way that they are not eating at the same place multiple times in a row or with the same people mutliple times in a row.
